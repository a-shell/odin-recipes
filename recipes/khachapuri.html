        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>With a cheese-stuffed crust and an egg baked into the center, this boat-shaped Georgian 
            bread is so fun and versatile, there's only a matter of time before it's delivered to 
            every home for pizza night and ordered from every brunch menu the morning after. 
            They take a little finesse but the payoff is well worth it; after all, what more could 
            you want other than cheesy, soft-while-chewy bread dipped in its own bed of runny egg 
            yolk and molten cheese?</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the dough:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup warm milk</li>
            <li>⅓ cup warm water</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2¼ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the cheese blend:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>4 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>8 ounces feta cheese, crumbled</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Rest:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, cut into 4 parts</li>
            <li>sea salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine milk, water, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Add olive oil, 2 cups flour, and salt. Mix until a sticky dough comes together.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead for about 3 minutes, adding in remaining flour as needed, until dough is very soft but still workable. Form into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Combine Monterey Jack, mozzarella, and feta cheeses in a bowl. Toss together and refrigerate until needed.</li>
            <li>Punch down dough and turn out onto a floured surface. Flatten slightly and cut in half. Dust a large sheet of parchment paper with flour. Place 1 dough half on top and roll out into a square about 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick, stretching out the corners as needed. Arrange 1/4 of the cheese in 2 rows, 1 to 2 inches from the longest sides. Roll sides up tightly over the cheese, forming a canoe shape around the dough. Pinch and twist ends to seal.</li>
            <li>Cut off excess parchment around the dough; lift dough onto a baking sheet. Repeat shaping and stuffing the other dough half. Fill the canoe with the remaining cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Form a well in the center of each khachapuri using a spoon; crack an egg inside each well.</li>
            <li>Return to oven and bake until eggs are mostly set, 3 to 4 minutes. Place 2 pats of butter over each filling and sprinkle salt and cayenne on top. Plate khachapuri; tear off one end and use it to stir the butter into the egg.</li>
        </ol>
